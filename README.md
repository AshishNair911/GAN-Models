# GAN Models

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of various Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures using PyTorch. The objective is to understand, replicate, and experiment with a wide range of GAN variantsâ€”from foundational models to cutting-edge advancements.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced by Goodfellow et al. in 2014, have become one of the most powerful frameworks in generative modeling. This project serves as a personal and educational resource for building and understanding GAN architectures from scratch, based on academic research and practical implementations.

The repository aims to:
- Recreate foundational GAN models from key research papers
- Maintain a modular and reusable codebase for experimentation
- Document training workflows and configurations
- Share insights through structured examples and visualizations
